# Torrent Tracker IP Checker

A fake torrent tracker which returns your IP address as the failure message.

## Why?

Provides a way for you to validate that your VPN or proxy is masking your real IP address.

## How?

Add this torrent to your client and view the list of trackers. The error message for this tracker will tell you which IP address hit the tracker.

You'll likely need to manually reannounce whenever you change your VPN or proxy settings to see your updated IP address.
